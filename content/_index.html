title: About Pastor Jeremy
callout: Pastor Jeremy grew up in a family full of church workers.
---

This led to a number of moves in his youth, though he primarily grew up in northern Illinois. After years of insisting he would not follow his grandparents and parents into education or ministry, the Holy Spirit led him to enroll at Concordia University- River Forest (now Chicago) upon graduating high school. From there he made his way to Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, graduating with his M.Div in 2009. His first call was to the Lutheran Church of St. John in Quincy, IL.

In March of 2015 Pastor Jeremy accepted a call to serve here at St. Paul.

Pastor’s family includes his wife, Ruth, and their two sons, Isaac and Ethan.

Outside of church pastor is a fan of the Chicago White Sox and Green Bay Packers, baking, and fantasy baseball.

What We Believe
The Lutheran faith is built around three basic principles –

These principles of Word Alone, Faith Alone, and Grace Alone are then articulated in what we call the six-chief parts of the Christian Faith. These six parts provide a summary of what we believe. 

They are outlined in Martin Luther's Small Catechism and they provide a clear explanation of the most important teachings found in the Bible. If you would like to have a copy of the Catechism, give us a call in the church office or reach out via email. We would love to give you one.


The Ten Commandments
The 10 commandments set out the requirements of God’s Law. They show us how God expects us to live our lives in a God-pleasing way. However, God reminds us through the 10 commandments that we all sin and fall short of God's standard. Thus we need a Savior who can forgive us from all our mistakes, failures, and short-comings.

The Apostles’ Creed 

The Creed summarizes the Bible’s teachings about God as he has chosen to reveal himself.  While the Creed has three parts to it (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), it has a special emphasis on Jesus.  It describes how he was born as a human being, suffered and died for our sins, and was raised to life again at the first Easter. In our worship services we use the Creed to confess together as a community of faith what we believe about God.

The Lord’s Prayer 

The disciples once asked Jesus, "How should we pray?" In response, Jesus taught them the simple prayer that we now call the Lord's Prayer. 

This prayer is the model for our own prayer life and it teaches us what we should ask God for.

The Lord’s Prayer also teaches us a great deal about what God is like and His priorities for His creation and our own lives.

This prayer invites us to trust Jesus for all God things and for his help in times of distress and temptation.

Holy Baptism

Baptism is the start of the Christian life!

Here at St. Paul we believe that all nations are invited to the waters of Holy Baptism. The gifts God pours out in this blessed gift are for babies and seniors, men and women, rich and poor, black and white, and everyone in between.

In Baptism you receive God’s gift of forgiveness. As if that weren’t enough, you are marked as one of His beloved children and made a member of His eternal family. In Baptism God rescues you from death and the devil and gives you the promise of eternal salvation.

It is also the basis for our life as a Christian, which Martin Luther portrays as a daily return to the waters of Baptism to receive its blessings new every day!

Confession and The Office of The Keys
 
The Christian faith is not just about reading words on a page, but about hearing God’s message of forgiveness with our own ears. The essence of confession is not our confession, but the words of absolution we hear from our pastor. These are words spoken in love and grace to assure each of us of the forgiveness of sins that comes from Christ. It is as if Christ himself were saying them to us.

The Sacrament of the Altar

Better known today as the Lord’s Supper or Holy Communion, this Sacrament lies at the heart of the Christian church’s weekly worship. The Lord’s Supper is not merely a symbolic meal, nor is it something that we offer back to God: it is, as Luther puts it, “the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, under the bread and wine”, in which “forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation are given us.”
